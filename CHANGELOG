-----------------------------------------------------------------------

v0.8 (17-Jul-2007)
 * The PSP version will start in usermode. I couldn't get the network
   module to work in the kernel mode either, and running the app in
   kernel mode caused other things go bad.
 * Added push and pop matrix calls to all video drawing functions.
 * Removed videoLoadIdentity() calls from the sprite drawing
   functions.
 * Removed as videoDrawRectangle2DWithPosition() as it can be
   done with videoDrawRectangle2D().
 * Updated the examples (Linux and PSP), they should be pretty
   clear now. Removed all references from code to Robots of Kill.

v0.7 (11-Jul-2007)
 * Removed videoDrawTriangle() as it can be done with other
   functions.
 * Gave better names to all the vertex formats and mesh drawing
   functions.
 * Made SDL main.c use the API, not poke the video values directly.
 * Added videoEnable() and videoDisable().
 * videoSetColor() doesn't enable/disable blending any more.
 * Removed PSP/src/file.c as Posix file i/o works fine on PSP.
 * Moved the message management from the networking subsystem to the
   game side (i.e., completely changed the network API).
 * Cleaned up the PSP version.

v0.6 (07-Jul-2007)
 * Initial release. GBAX2007 competition entry. Will be released to
   public later after the competition is over.
