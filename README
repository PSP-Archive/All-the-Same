1. DESCRIPTION

All the Same is yet another minimalistic multiplatform game framework
written in C. It's simple yet gives you most of the things you need
to write small games. And you gain instant ports to PSP, Windows and
Linux (more to come).


2. TODO

* More functions
* Port All the Same to new platforms
* A real documentation (API and usage)
* Optimizations
* C++?


3. REQUIREMENTS

All the Same is based on many other libraries. Here's what you need:

Linux & Win32:
* SDL (http://www.libsdl.org)
* OpenGL
* OpenAL, alut (http://www.openal.org)
* libvorbis, libvorbisfile, libogg (http://vorbis.com)

PSP:
* The PSP devkit from ps2dev.org (http://ps2dev.org)


4. USAGE

Go to the Linux / PSP directory and issue "make". It will compile the
test project. Currently there is no more documentation than this,
so you are on your own, sorry. Check out the sources of Robots of
Kill for more tips.

To create your own game, add more files to the projects. Start by
extending General/src/game.c, as that's where the user side of the
application is. You shouldn't touch any other C file, but of course can. :)

Note that the networking code doesn't work on PSP at the moment.
